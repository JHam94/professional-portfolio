# Purpose
This challenge required a professional portfolio to be built from scratch utilizing HTML and CSS learned in the bootcamp thus far. Various sections were created with the ability to link to their designated areas on the webpage when clicked on. Images displaying applications will link to the actual application or my GitHub homepage for future applications (noted by "placeholder"). This webpage has also been sized to fit various screen sizes/devices with media queries.
