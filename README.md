# Purpose
This challenge required a professional portfolio to be built from scratch utilizing HTML and CSS learned in the bootcamp thus far. Various sections were created with the ability to link to their designated areas on the webpage when clicked on. Images displaying applications will link to the actual application or my GitHub homepage for future applications (noted by "placeholder"). The "Contact Me" section will act similarly to previous sections where links will open pages in a new broswer (notice LinkedIn will go to the LinkedIn homepage as I do not want to link mine at this point in time). This webpage has also been sized to fit various screen sizes/devices with media queries.

## Built with
